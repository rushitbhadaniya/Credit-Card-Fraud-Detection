# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection 
In this project I build machine learning models to identify fraud in credit card transactions. 
## Requirements
Install R (and RStudio)
If you donâ€™t already have them, download and install R https://www.r-project.org/ and RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.

## Data Source
Here, I am using a dataset that is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud">Kaggle</a>.
It's a CSV file, contains 31 features, the last feature is used to classify the transaction whether it is a fraud or not.
